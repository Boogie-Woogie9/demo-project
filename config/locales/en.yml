  welcome: "Welcome to Ruby Test Platform!"
  info1: "This project was designed to test the knowledge of users in the field of software development in Ruby! On the site you will be able to take tests on knowledge of various aspects of the popular web programming language, as well as compete with other users."
  info2: "In the basement of the site you can find links to various resources that will be useful for both beginners and experienced users."
  ruby_info: "Ruby is a carefully balanced language. Its creator Yukihiro Matsumoto (also known as “Matz”), combined parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada and Lisp) to form a new language in which the functional programming paradigm is balanced by the principles of imperative programming. He often repeated that he was trying to make Ruby a natural, but not simple language that reflects life."
  quote1: 'Based on this, he adds:'
  quote2: "Ruby is simple in appearance, but very complex inside, like a human body."
