        Ruby is a carefully balanced language. Its creator Yukihiro Matsumoto
        (also known as “Matz”), combined parts of his favorite languages (Perl,
        Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada and Lisp) to form a new language in which the
        functional programming paradigm is balanced by the principles of
        imperative programming. He often repeated that he was trying to make
        Ruby a natural, but not simple language that reflects life.
      quote1: 'Based on this, he adds:'
      quote2: >-
        Ruby is simple in appearance, but very complex inside, like a human
        body.
